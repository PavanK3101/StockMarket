## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

```bash
python --version
````

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-dashboard.git](https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-dashboard.git)
    cd stock-market-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one with the following content:*

    ```
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    requests
    numpy
    ```

### API Key Configuration

This dashboard uses the Alpha Vantage API for stock data. By default, it uses the `demo` API key. For live data and to avoid rate limits, it is highly recommended to get your own free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.alphavantage.co/support/%23api-key) and replace `"demo"` in `stock_dashboard.py` (or the name of your main script file) within the `StockDataFetcher` class:

```python
class StockDataFetcher:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.alpha_vantage_key = "YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY" # Replace with your API key
        # ...
```

### Running the Dashboard

Once the dependencies are installed and your API key is configured (if desired), you can run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run stock_dashboard.py
```

(Replace `stock_dashboard.py` with the actual name of your Python script if it's different).

The dashboard will open in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.
